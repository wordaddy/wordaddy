yo, im word

yeah, i'm still learning how to program and i'm still learning the basics
so go easy, i might ask a lot of stuff, really simple ones lmao
i'm 17, and i'm in high school, so i guess it's a good time to learn how
to program with html, css and js, but still in the html and css part, learning 
buttons, colors, h1, p, style and some others like this.
